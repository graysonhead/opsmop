.. _language:

Language
--------

OpsMop configuration policies use a Python 3 DSL, or "Domain Specific Language".  Really this is not a new
language, but an idiomatic way of using Python.

You've hopefully already read ":ref:`local`" to understand what the command line commands are 
and are ready to see what the language is about.

In another tab, please open `the opsmop-demo repository <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/tree/master/content>`_. In particular, see 
minimal `hello.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/hello.py>`_.  All of these examples are runnable
on your computer from an OpsMop checkout.

.. _policy:

Policy
======

*Policies* are the top level objects in OpsMop.  *Policies* describe what :ref:`roles` get applied to a system being configured.

Read `hello.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/hello.py>`_ to see this structure in full.
Below, we'll talk about a few parts of that file in detail.

Since OpsMop is Python, we must always start by importing some classes. The following import is syntactic sugar to import the
most commonly used classes:

.. code-block:: python

    from opsmop.core.easy import *

If you had written your own *Types*, or wanted to pull in any python library at all, you could also import them here.

OpsMop policies are made excutable by adding a "__main__" clause that invokes the opsmop CLI code, turning a policy
file into an executable program. Here is a very basic Policy definition:

.. code-block:: python

    class Hello(Policy):
  
        def set_variables(self):
            return dict()

        def set_roles(self):
            return Roles(HelloRole())
   
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        Cli(Hello())

See :ref:`local` for how this file would be executed.  

Take special note of 'set_variables' and 'set_roles'. *Roles* are the real units of work in OpsMop. 
*Polices* say what *Roles* are applied, and optionally set some *variables*, but *Roles* will do all the work.

Assigning *variables* in a *Policy* declaration is optional, but *Roles* are not.
Why? A *Policy* without *Roles* has nothing to do!  We'll get to :ref:`roles` very shortly.

Python developers should note that objects in OpsMop have "args, kwargs" constructors, which means
you can pass a list of *Roles* to the Roles() collection instead of listing them all inside the constructor.  
This means you can dynamically return a list of *Roles* from arbitrary code very easily:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_roles(self):
        roles = [ HelloRole() ]
        return Roles(**roles_list)

That example is critical to the purpose of OpsMop!  While some configuration management systems mostly
are for humans writing content for them, any point in OpsMop can be grafted cleverly into software.
It is a cyborg automation system. So if you wanted to source your *Roles* (or :ref:`types`) by talking to another system, you can do that.
You aren't limited to just using constructs provided by the Opsmop system.

Sidenote: If you pass key=value arguments to a *Role* or *Policy*, it has the effect of also creating some variables, and this
is automatically possible for all *Policies* and *Roles*. Behold: parameterized values!

.. code-block:: python

    HelloRole(a=1, b=2)

Let's continue with more about Roles.

.. _roles:

Roles
=====

*Roles* describe what a configuration really does, and are the reusable core of OpsMop. Let's look at a simple
*Role* now:

.. code-block:: python

    class HelloRole(Role):

        def set_variables(self):
            return dict()

        def set_resources(self):
            return Resources(
                File(name="/tmp/foo.txt", from_file="files/foo.cfg")
            )

        def set_handlers(self):
            return Handlers()

Here we are doing something pretty basic, copying a file (see :ref:`module_file`).

Notice that we define resources in *Roles*, but you can't assign a resource to a *Policy* directly. Opsmop mandates
the usage of *Roles* as a mechanism of organization, but you can of course still only have one *Role* in a *Policy* you want.
How fine grained should *Roles* be?  It doesn't matter.
Most frequently a *Role* would describe an application deployment, but it might also describe something like a common security configuration, 
setting up a user's account (using parameterized *Roles*), and more. 

Parameterized *Roles* just involve passing key=value arguments to the *Role* constructor. Just to quickly
demo what this idea might look like, take a look at this:

.. code-block:: python

    class HelloPolicy(Policy):

        def set_roles(self):
            role = []
            apps = [ AppOne(), AppTwo() ]
            # these might come from a config file, up to you!
            users = [ UserRole(name='mpdehaan'), UserRole(name='you') ]
            roles.extend(users)
            roles.extend(apps)
            return Roles(roles)

Ok, so we've also introduced another method called 'set_handlers' and haven't explained it.  More on that in a bit. 
:ref:`handlers` will be introduced a little bit later in this chapter.

.. note:
    The method 'set_variables()' and 'set_handlers()' methods can always be omitted.  The method 'set_resources()' cannot.

.. _types:

Types
=====

As shown above, the set_resources() method on a *Role* returns a collection of resource *Types*.
We casually call them *Resources*, but technically the *Policy* and *Roles* are also subclasses of
*Resource*. *Types* are something much more specific.

What are *Types*? 

OpsMop modules are implemented in two parts: *Types* and *Providers*. *Types*, like "File()" above
describe a configuration intent - what we want to do to the system. 

*Providers* are implementations of the 'how', and work using the parameters passed to the *Providers*.
If writing OpsMop DSL language, you will be using *Types*. *Providers* are the beneveloent configuration 
spirits running behind the scenes. *Types* are what actually make the changes to systems happen.

Here is another example of a File *Type*, this time not copying a file, but merely
adjusting metadata:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            File(name="/tmp/foo.txt", owner='root', group='wheel', mode=0x755)
        )

Here we are using the same *File* resource as above, but using a few more parameters.

For those interested in :ref:`development`, when you browse the :ref:`modules`, each module page
will link to the *Type* and *Provider* code (for all *Providers*) on GitHub.  This makes it easy to understand
what a *Type* and *Provider* does. 

While we are new and still refactoring things, we value exceptually clean code, and it is encouraged that *Types* and *Providers* rely on
other classes and inheritance to keep their implementations especially clean and readable.

It is important to know that not all *Types* have just one *Provider* implementation.  For instance a *Package* could be installed
by yum, apt, or maybe pip or npm.  For details on how that works, see :ref:`method`.

The :ref:`modules` documentation shows all of the *Types* available in the core distribution.  Currently, this list is small
as OpsMop is under early (but extremely rapid) development.  Adding a new *Type* and *Provider* can often be done very quickly
thanks to the object model behind OpsMop.

When you review the module documentation, you will also see many common parameters exist on all *Types*, driving such features as conditionals, variable registration, and more.
These will be described in :ref:`advanced` and also demoed and featured in the :ref:`modules` documentation.  All :ref:`modules` documentation is actually
executable in the demo repo, and this will help you understand *Types* and *Providers* as you try them out.

.. _handlers:

Handlers
========

*Roles* can also declare *Handlers*. The *Handlers* section is just like the regular *Resources* section, except that *Handlers* run only when the system is
are changed by OpsMop. When OpsMop evaluates a *Type*, it determines a plan for that *Type* (in check or apply mode), and then
executes that plan (if in apply mode). 

For example, if a *Type* talks about a file needing to have certain modes, and the config file also has incorrect content, the plan would involve creating 
the config file, but also adjusting the modes. Replacing a config file is a good example of an event that would need to trigger restarting a *Service*.  That's the whole
purpose of *Handlers* - causing actions only when changes occur.

If actions are to be taken, all *Handlers* that match the given signaled names will fire
at the end of *Role* evaluation.

This probably makes better sense with an example. Here is a change being notified by a 'signal' from a resource:

.. code-block:: python

     def set_resources():
         return Resources(
             File(name="/etc/foo.conf", from_template="templates/foo.conf.j2", signals="restart_foo")
         )

     def set_handlers():
         return Handlers(
             Service(name='foo', restarted=True)
         )

In the above example, if the file was different on disk than what the template wanted, we would
restart service 'foo'. If the file was already correct, the service would not be restarted.

See also :ref:`module_file` and :ref:`module_service`.

.. note::
    Currently one *Role* cannot define *Handlers* for events signaled by another *Role*.  They are tightly
    namespaced and this is considered a feature.

Variables
=========

The method 'set_variables' on a *Resource* or a *Role* can define *variables*:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_variables(self):
        return dict(a=1, b=2, c=3)

We have also shown some examples above of parameterizing *Roles* and *Policies* when they are instantiated.

While simply returning a dict is fine, it's also possible to consult any external system for loading
up those variables.  This is, of course, a completely live Python program!  If you prefer to keep your
variables in CSV or JSON or YAML or XML files - a database - or to fetch them from a REST call, it is always
up to you.  This is why the set_variables() method is a overrideable function and not just a variable assignment.

These variables are best showcased with a more involved example, so now that you know variables are things, read on,
and in a bit prepare to dig into the example on :ref:`var_scoping`, which goes fully in on all the different
places variables can be set.

:ref:`facts` are also another way to get dynamic information into the system. Technically, ref:`facts` are not variables, 
they are really functions - but they are like variables that are always accessible in templates and conditionals. 
You will see more about facts as you browse the examples in the 'opsmop-demo' repository.  Facts also play a very
strong role in *Provider* selection, as detailed in :ref:`method`.

.. _templates:

Templates
=========

The most common (but not only) way to use variables in OpsMop are with templates.

Templates take *variables* and inject them into strings. Because Templates apply to not just
the :ref:`module_file`, but also other parts of OpsMop, they warrant a section in the language guide.

OpsMop uses `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ for templating, which is a powerful 
templating language that has quite a few capabilities beyond simple substitution, conditions, and loops.

The most basic use of *Jinja2* is variable substitution, for instance in a config file it might look like::

    marzlevanes=6
    defrobinicate="{{ defrobnicate }}"
    realign_main_deflector_array=True
    excelsior="{{ excelsior }}"

There are also conditionals, loops, and more.

The most common way of using templating is the :ref:`module_file`:

.. code-block: python
  
    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            File(name="/etc/foo.conf", from_file="templates/foo.conf.j2")
        )

It is important to understand templating in OpsMop works differently than in some other config systems. It is more explicit.
To avoid ambiguity, OpsMop does not automatically template every string. Only a few certain utility modules automatically assume their inputs are templates. 
One is :ref:`module_echo`:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Echo("My name is {{ name }}")
        )

To explictly template a string for some other parameter, we need to use 'T()':

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Package(name="foo", version=T("{{ major }}.{{ minor }}"))
        )

Any variable in the current scope is available to 'T()'.
However, all in-scope python variables are actually not.  To make them available to OpsMop you would need to add
them to the local scope.  This is also a design-consideration and part of OpsMop wanting to be explicit and unambigious:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        foo_version="8.67.5309"
        return Resources(
            Set(foo_version=foo_version),
            Package(name="foo", version=foo_version)
        )

.. note::
    Use of an undefined variable in a template will intentionally cause an error.
    This can be handled by using filters in *Jinja2* if you need to supply a default.
    This feature, while it may seem annoying, is actually a very good thing - you don't
    want an installation to continue with an improperly configured config file, when
    certain values are mysteriously blank.

.. note::
    Because template expressions are late binding, they will push some type-checking that would
    normally happen at validation to 'check' or 'apply' stages to runtime evaluation. To review, 
    see :ref:`local`. For example, if this
    file was missing, it might not be determined until halfway through the evaluation of a policy::

        File(name="/etc/foo.cfg", from_file=T("files/{{ platform }}.cfg"))

    This is usually completely safe if you understand all possible values of the variable. In the worst case,
    it will produce a runtime error if the file could not be found.

In Summary
==========

*Policies*, *Roles*, *Types*, and *Handlers* - along with *Variables* and *Templates* - make up the key concepts of OpsMop. 

There are many advanced language features available, which you should skim to get a feel of what is possible beyond
the simple examples here. See :ref:`advanced` next.

If you have not done so already, the 'opsmop-demo' repository is an excellent resource for learning
the language, as is :ref:`modules`.  These examples will provide a better understanding when read
along with this chapter.

Additional language features in :ref:`advanced` will help you understand how to do more detailed
things with OpsMop, and are also best understood when referring to both the 'opsmop-demo' repository
and the :ref:`modules`.

If you want to know more about the internals, check out :ref:`development`.

Should you have any specific questions, we'd also encourage you to stop by the :ref:`forum` as we would
be glad to help.
