Language Part 2
---------------

Once you have covered the basics of the language in :ref:`language`, there are many more
additional language features you may be interested in.

We say these are 'advanced' features not because they are complicated, but just because they
are optional.  These are the features that you should learn second, or maybe third, after
trying out a few modules.

Many simple configurations in OpsMop may simply use modules like
:ref:`module_service`, :ref:`module_package`, and :ref:`module_file`, and 
will not need all of these features, but it is also likely that every OpsMop
configuration will want to use at least some of the features explained below.

OpsMop encourages random-access learning.

The language examples below will refer to many modules detailed further in the :ref:`modules` section, so 
feel free to jump back and forth. The best way to understand these features is to consult
the `opsmop-demo <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo>`_ repo on GitHub, and also as you 
read through :ref:`modules`, you will see some of these features used in the examples in context.

Many of the examples are contrived and don't deploy real applications, but are constructed to teach 
lessons about things such as :ref:`var_scoping` or :ref:`conditionals`.  Real OpsMop policies
for deploying an application stack would be a bit longer and would use a larger mixture of modules in concert.

By studying these arbitrary examples though, you can quickly experiment and try to put
them together in your own :ref:`policy` configurations.

OpsMop does not believe you should need an extremely large library of example configurations, we want you to learn
the tool and be able to easily construct your own.

.. _method:

Provider Selection
==================

We've discussed Types a bit already.

When we talk about things like "File()", "Service()", or "Package()" in OpsMop, we call them resources,
but really resources come in two parts - Types and Providers.

Often, :ref:`types` may be coded to return only one provider.  Other modules may choose a default based
on the operating sysstem. As an example, the File() resource has only one implementation but there will be
many different implementations for Package().

Providers are the implementation code that make system changes as expressed in a Type.  The Type just defines
the request.

To install a package using the default *Provider*, we don't have to do anything special:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Package(name="cowsay")
        )

However, the default type is not always the one you will want to use.  For instance, the default
Package provider on Ubuntu would be "apt", and on CentOS 7 it would be "yum", but what if we wanted
to install a package from Python's pip?

To specify or force a specific provider:

.. code-block:: python
    
    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Package(name="pygments", method="pip")
        )

NOTE that at this point in OpsMop's development, we have a lot of providers to add for packages yet.
This makes a great point of contribution, so if you are interested, see the :ref:`community` section.

Ok, so that's how to pick a stock provider.

It's also possible to use a provider that OpsMop doesn't ship with, perhaps one that you wrote for
some of your own internal services:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Package(name="cowsay", method="your.custom.provider.spork")
        )

Expressing that full path for the provider name is verbose (and subject to typos), so it helps to save those strings to a python constant
to improve readability.

.. code-block:: python
    
    Package(name="cowsay", method=SPORK)

.. note:

    OpsMop is very new so providers will be growing rapidly for modules.  These are a great
    first area for contributions if you have needs for one.  See :ref:`development`.

.. note:

    It is deceptive to assume a package name is the same on all platforms.  Conditionals and various
    other systems allow solutions, but in the most common cases, your site content will just need
    to code for the platform you use.  While multi-platform content is interesting, if you don't need
    it, don't worry about it.

.. _var_scoping:

Variable Scoping
================

OpsMop uses variables in both templates and conditionals.

We've already talked a little bit about variables, and knowledge of variables weighs in on
future sections and nearly everything in OpsMop.  

It is important to not confuse Python variables with OpsMop variables.  To transfer a Python class variable
or global variable into OpsMop template space, use :ref:`module_set`.

OpsMop has a very simple to understand variable system based on the
concept of scope.  Variables defined at outer scopes are always available further
down, but changing a variable inside a scope does not effect the value at the outer scope.
These variables are 'scope-local'.

In the opsmop-demo repository, `var_scoping.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/var_scoping.py>`_ demonstrates
the various variable scopes in OpsMop. 

Because this is a long example, we'll refer you to GitHub and ask you to read and perhaps run the example. In browsing
the source, you will understand more about what is possible with variable scopes.

.. _eval:

Eval
====

Similar to T(), a computation of two variables is doable with Eval:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Set(a=2, b=3),
            Echo(Eval("a + b"))
        )

The difference with Eval() vs "T()" is that Eval can return native python types, whereas T() always
returns a string.  Here is a contrived example:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Set(a=2, b=3),
            Set(c=Eval('a+b')),
            Debug(a, b, c)
        )

In the above example, 'c' would be set to the number 5, not the string "5" (or worse, the string "23")

Where would you use this directly? Probably not very often. 

Eval is used to implement :ref:`conditionals`, described below.

.. _conditionals:

Conditions
==========

Any role, policy, or resource can be given a conditional.  If the conditional is true, that object 
will be skipped during the check or apply phase.

Expressions are specified with "when=", and accept valid `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ expressions.  This is technically
implemented using :ref:`eval` but leaving off Eval is provided as syntactic sugar:

.. code-block:: python

    # ...    
    Shell("reboot", when="a > b")
    # ...

This is the same as the overly redundant:

.. code-block:: python

    # ...
    Shell("reboot", when=Eval("a > b"))
    # ...

And while it serves no purpose that couldn't be achieved with a comment, technically this also disables
a resource:

.. code-block:: python

    # ...
    Shell("reboot", when=False)
    # ...

.. note::
    Development info: Both Eval() and T() are implementations of the class "Lookup", and you can write your own
    subclasses of Lookup if you wish to write any kind of runtime lookup into an external system.
    See :ref:`development`.

.. note::
    Python developers will be interested to know you can save common conditions to package or class variables, including
    Eval expressions.

.. note::
    Referencing an undefined variable in a condition will intentionally result in an error. This may be avoided
    by using `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ to select defaults. However, you could also just define a default with :ref:`module_set`
    prior to doing a 'register' call (see :ref:`registration`) and make things easy. That way, all variables will have defaults
    and you don't have to express the default from within a template.  This tip also works for general templating
    advice.

.. _nested_scopes:

Nested Scopes
=============

Resources in OpsMop can be nested, to attach variables at different scopes.  This is best demoed by 
`var_scoping.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/var_scoping.py>`_ which is a very
arbitrary demo but shows how it is done.

.. _registration:

Registration
============

The value of one command can easily be saved and fed into the output of another. 

This value is entered into local scope:

.. code-block:: python

    def resources(self):
        resources = Resources()
        resources.add([
            Shell('date', register='date'),
            Debug('date'),
            Echo("{{ date.rc }}"),
            Echo("{{ date.data }}")
        ])
        return resources

Registration works well with coupled with :ref:`conditionals`, :ref:`failed_when` and :ref:`changed_when`.
Some of these examples are shown in the 'opsmop-demo' repo.

.. note:
   In the documentation documentation occasionally we use "resources.add()" to build up the Resources lists
   or Roles lists in steps. This is simply a reminder that they are constructed programatically and you
   are not limited by creating them all at once. You can always pick whatever style you prefer.

.. note:
    Using Echo to show templates on the screen is a useful debug technique, but the :ref:`module_debug` module 
    is often easier.  Echo makes more sense for specific messages like "we're about to take down the
    fence power in the velociraptor exhibit".

.. note:
    Registration is most commonly used with shell commands. Most resources will probably not have very interesting 
    return data to use with 'register'.

.. note:
    There is no way to use Set() or register right now to copy a variable into global scope, which means
    registration only works for tasks at the same level of depth. A solution should be provided in the
    near future.

.. _tags:

Tags
====

OpsMop Tags are a feature where any certain resources in OpsMop can be selectively triggered without running all
of the other resources in the policy file.  

.. code-block:: python

    class DemoPolicy(Policy):
    
        def set_roles(self):

            return Roles(
                Security(tags=['security']),
                WebServer(tags=['webserver'])
            )

In the above example, if the opsmop binary was invoked with "-\\-tags=security", only the security role
would be processed.

The special tag name 'any' triggers regardless of what is specified with '-\\-tags'.  

Tags can be assigned to any resource or collection and automatically apply to all contained resources.
This is best demonstrated by the `tags.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/basics.py>`_ demo in the `opsmop-demo <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo>`_ repo.

.. _ignore_errors:

Ignore Errors
=============

Most commands will intentionally stop the execution of an OpsMop policy upon hitting an error. A common
example would be Shell() return codes. This is avoidable, and quite useful in combination with the register
command.  This is demoed in the :ref:`module_shell` documentation.

.. code-block:: python

    def resources(self):
        return Resources(
            Shell("ls foo | wc -l", register="line_count", ignore_errors=True),
            Echo("line_count.data")    
        )


.. _changed_when:

Change Reporting Control
========================

Normally, a resource will mark itself as containing changes if it performs any actions to the system.
Presence of these changes are used to decide whether to notify :ref:`handlers`.

Sometimes, particularly for shell commands, this is not appropriate, and the changed status
should possibly depend on specific return codes or output. The state can be overriden as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    Shell("/bin/foo --args", register="x", changed_when=Eval("'changed' in x.data"), notify="some_step")

If not using handlers, the change reporting isn't too significant, but is still useful to record whether or not
the policy evaluation made any changes. 

If no 'changed_when' clause is added to the Shell resource, it will always record that it made a change.

.. _failed_when:

Failure Status Overrides
========================

By default, if a resource returns a fatal error, the program will halt at that point. What causes an error like this? 
Errors could be a non-zero exit code from the :ref:`module_shell`, or any other time a provider might return a failed result that is not
a runtime exception. 

The problem is, sometimes return codes are not reliable.  Other times, return codes are not enough.

Here are a few examples of controlling when a resource should be considered failed:

.. code-block:: python

    Shell("/bin/foo --args", register="x", failed_when=Eval("x.rc != 5")

.. code-block:: python
    
    Shell("/bin/foo --args", register="x", failed_when=Eval("x.rc != 0 or not 'SUCCESS' in x.data"))

It may also be clearer to save that conditional string to a class or
package variable and use it this way:

.. code-block:: python

    SUCCESS_IN_OUTPUT = Eval("x.rc != 0 or not 'SUCCESS' in x.data")
    # ...
    def set_resources(self):
        # ...
        Shell("/bin/foo --args", register="x", failed_when=SUCCESS_IN_OUTPUT)
        # ...

.. _hooks:

Hooks
=====

Every single object in the OpsMop language may define some special methods. These are most useful on *Roles* and *Policies*
but can also be used on any *Type* instance if you subclass the Type.

.. _hooks_post:

post()
~~~~~~

This method is called after a resource is evaluated.

This is demoed in `user_facts.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/user_facts.py>`_ to
demonstrate invalidating the facts cache (see :ref:`facts`) in between role executions.

Both pre and post can do literally anything you want.

The return values are ignored.

.. _hooks_pre:

pre()
~~~~~

The opposite of post().

A pre method would be called prior to evaluating a role in either check or apply mode. 

The most trivial use of pre might be to print a quick message when entering a role, without relying on :ref:`module_echo`.


.. _hooks_should_execute_when:

should_execute_when()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is powerful. This method is called to decide whether a resource should be executed at all. 

In the example `user_facts.py <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo/blob/master/content/user_facts.py>`
we cleverly use should_execute_when() to implement feature flags - a given *Role* skips entirely when a fact is not set.
This is also an easy way to make a role that only runs on a certain platform.  Thus OS specific parts of a multi-OS deployment
can be split up into different roles, while still retaining common roles in other parts.

(See also :ref:`facts`).

.. note:

    While could attach a "when" condition to a role when instantiating it (see :ref:`conditionals`), should_execute_when() is perhaps a more readable way to do it.
