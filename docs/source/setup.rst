Setup
=====

* OpsMop is still new so these instructions describe running from a git checkout only.
* Versioned releases to PyPi will occur in 2019.

.. _python3:

Python 3
--------

OpsMop requires Python 3.  

.. _python3_linux:

Python 3 on Linux/Unix
----------------------

Skills test!

If needed, please install Python 3.6 or higher.

.. _python3mac:

Python 3 on Mac OS X
--------------------

If not already installed, use Homebrew::

    brew install Python

And::
    
    # vim ~/.bashrc
    export path=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    alias python /usr/local/bin/python3

And::

    source ~/.bashrc

And::

    easy_install-3.7 virtualenv
    virtualenv env -p /usr/local/bin/python3

And::

    source env/bin/activate

.. _checkout:

Git Checkout and Dependencies
-----------------------------

Checkout both opsmop demo and the demo content::

    git clone https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop.git
    git clone https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo.git 

Don't forget about that demo repo!  It's the best way to learn OpsMop.

Now install python dependencies with pip::

	cd opsmop/
	make requirements

.. _first_test:	

Trying Things Out
-----------------

The other chapters will explain opsmop in greater depth, but let's see
if this works, just running from source::

    cd opsmop-demo/content
    PYTHONPATH=/path/for/checkout/of/opsmop python3 hello.py --local --apply
    
.. _pypi:	

What About PyPi?
----------------

Versions of opsmop will be available in PyPi after the first release in 2019.

The instructions above discuss running from source, which is useful if you are developing
on the program.  Once installed, everything will work the same way, except PYTHONPATH
will not need to be set.

You can of course also "chmod +x" any policy file to avoid having to specify the interpreter.

Setup Problems or Questions?
----------------------------

There are lots of new things and some part of the documentation may even be lies!
Actually no, but we're working on a lot of things yet. We'd love to help you out and
hear about what you want to do. Stop by the :ref:`forum` and get to know us.
Understanding what you want to do helps us build a better OpsMop.
